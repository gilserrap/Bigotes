# Bigotes

This is a proof of concept for a generator of mapping structs using SwiftyJSON and GRMustache.

Better explain it in gifs:

###This is you writing a parser in swift:

###This is you watching everything not work as you expected:
![monete](Gif/monete.gif)

###This is what I want you to look like when writing a parser:
![magic](Gif/magic.gif)


As the project grows more interesting I'll write something more specific.
